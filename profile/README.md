# SynaesthetiQ

SynaesthetiQ is a music visualiser prototype using envelope following, frequency analysis and genre detection to create engaging visualisations of music in real-time. This project was started as part of a Real-time Embedded Programming undergraduate project at the University of Glasgow. These repositories include all of the code written during the project, as the prototype was developed, and for a demonstration.
